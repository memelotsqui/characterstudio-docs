# Character Traits


Setting up this manifest will populate the asset trait section with your own traits that people can select from. It will also serve the character studio for cull trait model options (remove faces underneath) based on the layers, so the triangles disappear underneath the clothing for example.

# Culling Distance

Culling distance is defined in an array of 2 numbers [outer, innner]

Outer represents how far a raycast will go outside in normal direction before it detects collision, if it collides, it means the vertex is not visible as it is blocked by another trait with higher culling layer.

Innner represents how far a raycast will go inside in normal direction before it detects collision, if it collides, it means the vertex is not visible as it is blocked by another trait with higher culling layer.

This options only affects how the trait is affected by other traits.
